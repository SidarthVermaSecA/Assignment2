In this landing page, I have used various CSS elements/pseudo-classes to make it look stylish and responsive. Media queries have been used to make it functional on multiple platforms and adaptable. I have divided the page into sections and each section has its components resonating with the company's products and its ideas.  

All the semantic elements were used to make it more SEO-friendly and accessible.
